class HoverEnv(BaseEnv):
    r"""
    A basic control task. The goal for the agent is to maintain a stable
    position and heading in mid-air without drifting. This task is designed
    to serve as a sanity check.

    ## Observation

    The observation space consists of the following part:

    - `rpos` (3): The position relative to the target hovering position.
    - `drone_state` (16 + `num_rotors`): The basic information of the drone (except its position),
      containing its rotation (in quaternion), velocities (linear and angular),
      heading and up vectors, and the current throttle.
    - `rheading` (3): The difference between the reference heading and the current heading.

    ## Reward

    - `pos`: Reward computed from the position error to the target position.
    - `heading_alignment`: Reward computed from the alignment of the heading to the target heading.
    - `up`: Reward computed from the uprightness of the drone to discourage large tilting.
    - `spin`: Reward computed from the spin of the drone to discourage spinning.
    - `effort`: Reward computed from the effort of the drone to optimize the
      energy consumption.
    - `action_smoothness`: Reward that encourages smoother drone actions, computed based on the throttle difference of the drone.

    The total reward is computed as follows:

    ```{math}
        r = r_\text{pos} + r_\text{pos} * (r_\text{up} + r_\text{spin}) + r_\text{effort} + r_\text{action_smoothness}
    ```

    ## Episode End

    The episode ends when the drone misbehaves, i.e., it crashes into the ground or flies too far away:

    ```{math}
        d_\text{pos} > 4 \text{ or } x^w_z < 0.2
    ```

    or when the episode reaches the maximum length.
